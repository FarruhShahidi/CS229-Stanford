\begin{answer}
   By replacing with the Laplace density, we get
$$
l(W) = \sum_{i=1}^m(\log |W| + \sum_{j=1}^m(c - |w^T_jx^{(i)}|)).
$$
In order to evaluate the gradient, we consider cases when the absolute value positive and negative.:
$$
sign^{(i)}_j = \begin{cases}
1, &w_j^Tx^{(i)} >0\\
-1, &w^T_jx^{(i)}\le 0
\end{cases}
$$

Now we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_Wl(W) &= \sum_{i=1}^m (W^{-1T} -  sign^{(i)}x^{(i)T})
\end{aligned}
$$

We can write a vectorized update

$$
W:= W + \alpha(W^{-1T}  - Sign x^T)
$$
where Sign is a vector consisting of $sign^{(i)}$'s.
