\begin{answer}
Write $f(x) = D_{KL }(p_\theta\|p_x)$ and approximate $f(\theta + d) = f(\theta) + d^T\nabla(f(\theta)) + d^T\nabla^2(f(\theta))d$
We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
D_{KL }(p_\theta\|p_{ \theta + d})&\approx D_{KL}(p_\theta\| p_{\theta}) + (d)^T\nabla_{\theta'}D_{KL}(p_\theta\| p_{\theta'}} +  \frac{1}{2}d^T\mathcal I(\theta) d
(
&=  \frac{1}{2}d^T\mathcal I(\theta) d
\end{aligned}
$$
This is because the first term in the above sum is clearly 0, and the second term is zero according to part (b).
