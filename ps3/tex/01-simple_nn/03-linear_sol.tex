\begin{answer}
Not possible.
    If the function is linear then as the composition of linear functions is also linear then it would follow that $o$ can be written as
    $o = a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + b$ for some parameters $a_1,a_2.b.$ Since this represents a single line, it is not possible
    for this line to separate the positive and negative examples.
