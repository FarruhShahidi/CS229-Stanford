\begin{answer}
This is similar to the case of (b) and (c). In this case we find the parameter
$$\gamma = \frac 1b.$$
As for the $J(\theta)$ formula, not that the $\epsilon$ is normal hence the probability
$p(y|x, \theta)$ is given by the Gaussian density. So we need to minimize the negative exponen
of this density, which is exactly $||X\theta - y||.$
