\begin{answer}
In the logistic regression part of the problem set 1 we saw that for the best $\theta$
$$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_i} = - \frac{1}{m}\sum_{k = 1}^{m }x_i^{(k)}( y^{(k)} - h_{\theta}(x^{(k)})) = 0.$$
Note that in the formula we want to prove the denominator is the same. The fact that the numerator is the same follows from
the above equation.
