\begin{answer}
Perfectly calibrated model should not necessarily imply model accuracy. 
Also, converse is not true. Consider an example in 2D case where positive example are around (1,1) and negative examples are around the origin and positive and negative examples are equal. In this case the probability will not show 50\%. Then heuristic function is close to zero or close to 1.
